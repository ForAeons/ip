# It's Duking Time

## Duking Time lets you duke whenever you want, wherever you can run java. It is:
- Not scalable
- Offline only
- Not easy to use

### Prerequisites:
1. Familiarity with command line
2. Familiarity with Java, a high level, garbage collected, statically typed, compiled and interpreted, object oriented, perfect programming language 

### Features:
- [ ] Blazingly fast [🦀](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (not possible unless you use ruby, python or javascript)
- [X] Add and keep track of your tasks, except occasionally making you yell when missing a "/\" in the command
- [X] Easily see all of your tasks by dumping all of your tasks at once instead of pagination
- [X] Very intuitive marking/deletion of tasks by ids instead of task details
- [X] Persistent storage of your tasks in a offline app that probably only runs on your pc instead of putting it in a cloud based cross-platform service that syncs your tasks across all of your devices
- [X] Very robust app with 0.1% test coverage
- [x] Impressive GUI that uses JavaFX instead modern web frameworks such as svelte

### It is free!
- Except it is a waste of your time to use it
